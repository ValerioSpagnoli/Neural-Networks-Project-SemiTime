# Neural Networks Project -- SemiTime

This repository containts my project for Neural Network course of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics of La Sapienza University. \
The project is about the following paper: **Semi-supervised time series classification by temporal relation prediction** (https://haoyfan.github.io/papers/SemiTime_ICASSP2021.pdf). \
In this work the authors have proposed a method of semi-supervised time series classification architecture (termed as **SemiTime**) by gaining from the structure of unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner.
